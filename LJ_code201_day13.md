<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 13</h1>

I thought I was lost for a couple hours, but it turned out I had it. I wasn't sure where to plug in the local storage code, but Aaron helped guide me toward that. Sam helped me fix my code a little more and taught me how to delete and refresh the local storage in my browser.

I'm working on a table, but that's proving to be harder than I realized. I'll have to work on styling the web app tonight and will submit later.
