<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 1</h1>

The first day was very informative. It was a lot of information to take in, but I'm glad to have caught up with the reading and to have finished tutorials. I got a little scared I fell behind during some of the terminal exercises, but I managed to get caught up.

I am also grateful I purchased a Mac for this bootcamp. It helped streamline things much more easily.

I need to change my browser to Chrome, however. It'll be easier to follow along with class using Chrome.

I'm excited to get more deeply involved in coding as time goes on. I'm a little scared about being overwhelmed, but I understood what I was getting into when I signed on. I hope I'm ready.
