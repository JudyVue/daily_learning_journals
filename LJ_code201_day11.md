<h1> LJ Code 201 Day 11</h1>

Today sucked balls hard. I struggled a lot and Sam basically had to handhold me through setting up my random picture generator and ensuring it didn't repeat images. I've barely made progress past that on my own.

I had a lot of code started and was generating images, but it turned out my architecture was just too overwhelmingly inefficent and wrong that Sam had to make me start over from scratch.

Also demoralized that I didn't realize my table hadn't rendered correctly in the salmon cookies project when it rendered before.

My head hurts. I need sleep.
