<h1> LA Code 201 Day 5</h1>

TGIF!!!!!!

I learned a lot about making clean code and TAs were very helpful. I passed Quiz 2 and really excited to work on my About Me project and improve on it.

I learned that functions can be called inside functions, and I learned the importance of more effiecient coding. Less is always more, and I'm going to try to implement this in my coding as much as I can.
