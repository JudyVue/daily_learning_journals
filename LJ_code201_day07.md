<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 7</h1>

I'm really glad we're learning constructor objects. SO MUCH BETTER THAN LITERAL OBJECTS. Thanks to extra tips from Sam, I was able to figure out how to easily render my table and I was able to help my tablemates Britt and Rachael.

I got stuck on figuring how to sum up the columns in the final row, but that was a stretch goal, so I'll put that off to work on reading and finishing this journal.

Lots of frustration and roadblocks, as there always is. I'm looking forward to this week, but I'm not looking forward to trying to make this site pretty. I'm not a designer at all. AHHH!
