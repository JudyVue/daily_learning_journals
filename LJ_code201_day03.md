<h1> LJ Code 201 Day 3</h1>

Holy crap, this day was difficult. I spent an hour writing one line of code to finish the first prompt, which asked us to get a number as a user input, and give the user 4 times to answer. I was having trouble getting my original work to run in the browser, so I was figuring out what I was doing wrong to cause that to happen.

I'm still not sure what the problem was, except after a bit of spacing here and there, I finally got it working.

After I mastered the for loop for this first part, I on to making a while loop and a nested for loop for the second portion, in which I created an array and gave the user 6 changes to answer the question correctly so that the answer matched with an array element. This needed substantial assistance from Sam and Aaron, which I am completely grateful for. My code is still not perfect, but at least it works. 

I got my code working and accomplishing the assignment parameters, but I know it could be so much better. I want to learn more efficient coding and I want to work smarter, not harder.
