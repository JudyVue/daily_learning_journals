<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 8</h1>

Today was tough. Managed to push through with lots of help from Munir and Aaron.

I realized my code was very convoluted and had way too many functions in one function. From now one, I want to be a lot better at making my functions concise instaed of creating a HAM.

I also realized I had some minor mistakes with not typing the correct HTML 'id' name when trying to create variables in JavaScript. E.g., I realized I had declared a variable trying to pull an HTML element with id "clearButtonInfo" when actually, I had named that id "clearButton." Aaron helped me backtrack to figure that out.

Munir helped me find a neat trick within my huge function to apply my functions to all stores instead of calling the function each store multiple times in teh bottom of my code.

Forms are hard. I got the basic minimum requirements of the assignment, but something is off with my math, and I don't know what. Need a break!
