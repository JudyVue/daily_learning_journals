<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 12</h1>

Today sucked hard and it sucked a little less. Sam code reviewed my code and helped make it better. That huge while loop made me want to vomit, but this was one of those assignments where it's better to work harder instead of smarter.

I managed to walk myself through most of the chart rendering exercises on my own. Aaron helped walk me through some fixes when I ran into snags. I realized that taking a break after a long slow burn really helped me out.

I was seriously frustrated yesterday, but now I feel a lot better about myself.
