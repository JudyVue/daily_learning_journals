<h1> LJ Code 201 Day 16</h1>

My team had a productive day today. I'm stuck on trying to figure out how to create an array of yes's and no's as our team did not have our code set up to do that easily. I'm working on it. Hopefully it's solved by tomorrow. Maelle and Rachael are great resources to bounce ideas off of.
