<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 6</h1>

Today was tough again. I thought I had the salmon cookies project down, then realized I didn't, and after much backspacing and deleting and breaking my code, I'm ALMOST there. I'm currently trying to render my code now. Little difficult because the loop keeps iterating so I get fourteen pieces of data for each array. BAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Back to coding.
