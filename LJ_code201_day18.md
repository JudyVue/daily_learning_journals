<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 18<h1>

Is Day 18 Wednesday or Thursday??? I lost track and this journal is admittedly late, among other assignments.

I've been so busy with the project I've sadly neglected this, but trying to play catchup. I'm just learning a lot about collaborative learning and I'm seeing the huge benefits of having people who can take on a project. I think my teammates and I complement our skills together.
