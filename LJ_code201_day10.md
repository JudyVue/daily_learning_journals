<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 10</h1>

This was a tough day and CSS is difficult and I won't be taking it for granted anymore. I have an appreciation for simple design and keeping things as basic as possible. I have a hatred for websites that want to incorporate different fonts everywhere.

It was good to have Britney as a partner. She had a good eye and attention to detail.
