<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 15</h1>

Today was a good day. I learned a lot from the Code 301 presentations, specifically to keep project scopes simple. I had a good day planning with Rachael and Maelle and am looking forward to project week. It's going to be a lot of planning, but I think it'll be a great project in the end.
