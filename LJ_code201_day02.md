<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 2</h1>

My brain is fried. I wish I was a better design person, but I'm really only here to get good at JS.

I realize I should get my head out of JS and really focus on HTML/CSS to make things pretty.

I realize CSS is important and shouldn't be ignored.

I wis my code was better and more efficient. Hopefully that improves over time.

My brain hurts and I have to do more reading. AHH!!!
