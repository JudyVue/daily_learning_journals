<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 4 </h1>

Today was a good and productive day. After pair programming with Michael, I learned a lot of things wrong with my code. It was good to have second pair of eyes (and third and fourth, with additional assistance from Sam, Aaron, and Munir).

I realize the importance of sticking to the prompt and not trying to go above and beyond with projects. This class is fast-paced, but I shouldn't be trying to go faster than the pace we're going at or else I'll get ahead of myself and create a mess that is a pain to resolve later.

This happened when I was trying to fork Michael's stuff off Github. I had forked it and put it into my local directory during lunch, but when he came back, he needed to do one more commit. So I had to re-fork all over again, but this time around, I think I cloned his direct GitHub about me repo, not the actual fork I gave to myself. AHHHH!!!

So Aaron had to teach me a new command in git called git remote -v so I could see what remote directory I was linked to. I had problems pushing the new material online because I was still connected to Michael's account, which I don't have permissions to.

If I had just waited for Michael to come back from lunch and forked his material then, I never would have had this problem.

There are lots of other problems I had, particularly with creating a function in my project on Day 2 when that wasn't part of the parameters. But I've learned my lesson to slow the hell down and listen closely to the prompts.
