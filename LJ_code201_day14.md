<h1>LJ Code 201 Day 14</h1>

I enjoyed my group. We have a project idea and I'm excited to start it next week. We worked well together in lab, so I expect we'll work well together next week.

Brian's lectures on CSS were awesome too. I also appreciated Aaron's breakdown of prototype. Today was an informative day and I'm looking forward to group projects.
